# House Rent Prediction

![Project Workflow](https://img.shields.io/badge/Pipeline-EDA%20%7C%20FE%20%7C%20Modeling%20%7C%20Evaluation-brightgreen)

## üöÄ Project Overview
This repository contains an end-to-end machine learning project for predicting monthly rents of properties based on features such as square footage, number of bedrooms/bathrooms, region, and various amenities. The entire workflow is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook, covering:

- Data acquisition via Kaggle API  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Feature Engineering (FE)  
- Model training & hyperparameter tuning (Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)  
- Model evaluation (RMSE, MAE, residual analysis)  

## üìä Dataset
The dataset is sourced from Kaggle: [House Rent Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rkb0023/houserentpredictiondataset). It includes 265,190 listings from Craigslist across different US regions.

| Column                  | Description                                    |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| `price`                 | Monthly rent in USD                            |
| `sqfeet`                | Square footage of the property                 |
| `beds`                  | Number of bedrooms                             |
| `baths`                 | Number of bathrooms                            |
| `cats_allowed`          | Cats allowed (0/1)                             |
| `dogs_allowed`          | Dogs allowed (0/1)                             |
| `laundry_options`       | Laundry availability (e.g., in-unit, on-site)  |
| `parking_options`       | Parking type (e.g., street, garage)            |
| `region`                | Geographic region (city or metro area)         |
| `type`                  | Property type (apartment, house, etc.)         |

Other columns (URLs, descriptions, images, etc.) are dropped during feature engineering.
